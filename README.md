# Visitor-Management-System

The Visitor Management System is a Java web application developed using JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and Apache Tomcat.
This project is used to store and manage visitor details in an organization. It allows the user to add visitor information, view a particular visitor record, and view all visitor records from the database.

The application uses JSP for the front end, Servlets for handling requests, and JDBC for database connectivity. This project helped me understand Java web application development and how to connect Java applications with a database.
